<h2 class="star"><span>What</span></h2>
<div class="clr"></div>
Ontology that leverages already existing ontology (the <a href="www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/ssn/ssnx/ssn">W3C SSN ontology</a>, among others) and ontology design patterns (<a href="http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/">the Event Model F ones</a>, among others) to enable semantic descriptions of sensors, sensor data, sensor networks, the context around them with a focus on energy saving.
</div>
<div class="gadget">
<h2 class="star"><span>Why</span></h2>
<div class="clr"></div>
The unambiguity and schema-indepenedency features that characterize
RDF, are the key to enable 
<ul>
	<li>plug-and-play sensor nodes</li>
	<li>interoperability among different sensors.</li>
</ul>
Also the context around a sensor observation, can be addressed at any level of granularity and structured according to its mereology, participants and causality features.

              <p>
The<span style="font-weight: bold">SPITFIRE Ontology</span> (spitf) is based on the alignment among Dolce+DnS Ultralite(dul), the W3C Semantic Sensor Network ontology (ssn) and the Event Model-F ontology (event).<br />
Additional ontologies that have been reused and/or aligned are the Friend Of A Friend (foaf), Measurement Unit (muo), Online Presence (opo) and Association (ao) ones.
The SPITFIRE ontology is composed by the modules showed in Figure 1. It has a focus on 
<ul>
<li>energy saving in building automation (the <a href="http://spitfire-project.eu">SPITFIRE consolidated use case</a>) thus allowing to monitor and describe both the structure and the performances of sensor networks and their components.</li>
<li>modeling any kind of activity / event that has been sensed together enriched by descriptions of the surrounding environment. The SPITFIRE ontology enables a full and rich description of, not only sensor data but also the sensed event, its structure, what triggered it and its relation with other activities. An activity can be also a Presence somewhere or a Status (either online or offline).</li>
</ul>
The namespace for the SPITFIRE ontology is http://spitfire-project.eu/ontology/ns# (<a href="http://spitfire-project.eu/ontology.owl">OWL</a>, last update: 30 April 2012) .<br />
Specific types and instances related to Context are defined in http://spitfire-project.eu/ontology/ns/context-types .<br />
Specific types and instances related to Sensor Networks are defined in http://spitfire-project.eu/ontology/ns/sn-types# .<br />
